Simple tutorial for starting builders.

== [ CREATING ROOMS ] ==

> edig north The Fun Room	
(edig <exit> <short description/title>)

OR, you can also do it the hard way: 

> addroom
Will output a new room IDs. Remember it.
> addlink <origin> <destination> <direction> 
Do it for the other way around if you want a two-way exit.

Example:
> addroom
Your new room has id #23
> addlink 1 23 north
> addlink 23 1 south

You can now move between room #1 and room #23 by going north/south.
