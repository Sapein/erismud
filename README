ErisMUD 0.5.1

ErisMUD is a MUD engine written from scratch in Python using SQLite for storing 
data. ErisMUD is distributed under the GPL. It is a work-in-progress but already
has many features:

- Creating/destroying/listing rooms, items, NPCs with a single command.
- Adding aliases to objects.
- Optional ANSI colors.
- Basic health/damage system.
- Talking using the "say" command, chatting using the "chat" command.
- Cloning items, dropping them on the floor, getting them, giving them to other players.
- Instances: a single object may be cloned multiple times and every instance is
  independent.
- Easily add or modify help files with a single command.
- Logging.

Read the TUTORIAL file for a quick overview of the possibilities.

== INSTALL ==
No install is required for ErisMUD, other than Python 2.5. If you have an older Python release, 
you will have to download the pysqlite [http://www.pysqlite.org] module for that version.

To start the server, simply edit the parameters in eris.conf
and the login welcome message in motd.txt and start the server by running:
# python eris.py

Don't forget to add your player name to the 'coders' file (one per line) in
order to use the coder-only commands.

== REQUIREMENTS ==
- Python 2.5 
  *or*
- Python 2.3+   (http://python.org)
- SQLite 3.2    (http://www.sqlite.org)
- pysqlite 1.0+ (http://www.pysqlite.org)

I did not test ErisMUD with previous versions.

== KNOWN ISSUES ==

* Since handle_error() is subclassed, no python error is ever raised. This makes
  debugging difficult. Comment out SecondServSock.handle_error() in eris.py to see errors.
