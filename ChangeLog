    * User-defined settings now stored in eris.conf.
    * A player won't see himself when looking at the room anymore.

    * Fixed a bug in the 'quit' command.

    * Fixed a stupid bug in user creation that prevented login.
    * Default description set when creating items/NPCs/characters to avoid slicing errors.
    * 'kickout' command added - kicks a player out of the game, without banning em.

    * Rewrote do_look() and it now returns an error message when the argument is not there.
    * Query aliases removed, were not used.
    * The logout bug when having more than one character from the same IP was NOT fixed
      after all. But it should be now.
    * NPCs can now hold inventory - added a 'npc_own' column in the instances table.
      You can give items to NPCs and see what they hold by looking at them.

      the item name X times.

    * ANSI colors are now optional and set during character creation. It can be changed later
      by doing 'setansi [on|off]'
    * Names not allowed can be put in the 'badnames' file, one per line. If a player named has
      these words anywhere in their name, it will be refused.
    * Aliases added to items. Admin command 'addalias' created.
    * Email is now asked at player creation. Stored into new 'email' column.
    * New 'email <name>' command added to show the user's address.
    * do_listplayers() updated to show the emails.

    * help command divides the help topics in two columns.
    * Fixed a bug in do_give(), where no arguments would boot you out, found by S. Vogel.
    * Multiplaying is now blocked by default, except for localhost. Fixed a bug that
      would half-logout the second character. Thanks again to S. V. for finding it.
    * All description commands (for players, items, npcs and rooms) can now include
      linebreaks by including '\n' in the description string.

      properly implemented.
    * Now with case-insensitive goodness everywhere.
